# react-01

**Gulp and Babel React application.**
  The app allows user to post, delete, and earmark abusive comments.

##Install
  1. Clone the repo
  2. npm install -g gulp to install Gulp globally.
  3. npm install to resolve project dependencies.

##Run app
input 'npm start' from the command line

## Dev Goal
I started this app after completing Code Schools React tutorial.  I mainly built it from the slides, so it was a painful slow process with lots of debugging opportunities.
Ultimately, it was an great way to familiarize myself with the front end framework.

##Future Development
Not suprisingly this app does not resemble the CS app. Future development will refactor to resemble the WatchUsBuild series and expand on that tutorial.
