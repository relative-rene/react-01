# react-01

**Gulp and Babel React application.**
  The app allows user to post, delete, and earmark abusive comments.

##Install
  1. Clone the repo
  2. npm install -g gulp to install Gulp globally.
  3. npm install to resolve project dependencies.

##Run app
input 'npm start' from the command line

## Dev Goal
I started this app after completing Code Schools React introduction.  It was a slow and bug filled process, so it was a great way to familiarize myself with React's front end framework.  

##Future Development
In future development, I will reorganize and refactor current app to resemble WatchUsBuild start point, so I can observe their development process.
This app can also serve as a great SPA comment boilerplate.
I will add the ability to like or up vote popular comments.
